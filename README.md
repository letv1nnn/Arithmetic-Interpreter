# Creating-my-own-interpreter-virtual-machine-and-compiler.

This is a project where I'm building an interpreter, virtual machine, compiler, and possibly more low-level components from scratch. It's essentially an extended version of the Per Vognsen's course problems.

## April 4 - April 12:
I've created structured small versions of all, interpreter, compiler and virtual machine.
CODE ---> https://github.com/letv1nnn/Creating-my-own-interpreter-virtual-machine-and-compiler./blob/main/interp_vm_compiler.c
1. Created a buffer with "custom memory allocators":).
2. Implement String interning, optimization technique used to save memory and improve performance when working with strings.
3. Created parser, lexer. For lexer I used Abstract Syntax Tree.
4. INTERPRETER
5. VIRTUAL MACHINE AND COMPILER

## April 5 - ...(Present)
I am extending each of the interpreter, virtual machine, and compiler with various features, etc...
