# Creating-my-own-interpreter-virtual-machine-and-compiler.

This is a project where I'm building an interpreter, virtual machine, compiler, and possibly more low-level components from scratch. It's essentially an extended version of the Per Vognsen's course problems.

## April 4 - April 12 - small versions of all, interpreter, compiler and virtual machine.
CODE ---> https://github.com/letv1nnn/Creating-my-own-interpreter-virtual-machine-and-compiler./blob/main/interp_vm_compiler.c
I've created structured small versions of all, interpreter, compiler and virtual machine.

## April 13 - April 14 - Creating MALLOC, FREE and GC
CODE ---> https://github.com/letv1nnn/Creating-my-own-interpreter-virtual-machine-and-compiler./tree/main/memory_allocation
I've made a simple version of a memory allocator to understand how it works. 
Furthermore, I've created a full stack of memory allocator, deallocator and simple garbage collector.
## Plans
Extend each of the interpreter, virtual machine, and compiler with various features, etc...
