# Creating-my-own-interpreter-virtual-machine-and-compiler.

This is a project where I'm building an interpreter, virtual machine, compiler, and possibly more low-level components from scratch. It's essentially an extended version of the Per Vognsen's course problems.

### Usefull books:
- Wirth's Compiler Construction (https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/CompilerConstruction)

## April 4 - April 12 - small versions of all, interpreter, compiler and virtual machine.
CODE ---> https://github.com/letv1nnn/Creating-my-own-interpreter-virtual-machine-and-compiler./blob/main/interp_vm_compiler.c
I've created structured small versions of all, interpreter, compiler and virtual machine.
1. Created a buffer with "custom memory allocators":).
2. Implement String interning, optimization technique used to save memory and improve performance when working with strings.
3. Created parser, lexer. For lexer I used Abstract Syntax Tree.
4. INTERPRETER
5. VIRTUAL MACHINE AND COMPILER

## April 13 (Day off) - Creating MALLOC, FREE and GC
CODE ---> https://github.com/letv1nnn/Creating-my-own-interpreter-virtual-machine-and-compiler./tree/main/memory_allocation
I've made a simple version of a memory allocator to understand how it works. 
Furthermore, I've created a real memory allocator using specific libraries.

## April 14 - ...(Present)
I am extending each of the interpreter, virtual machine, and compiler with various features, etc...
