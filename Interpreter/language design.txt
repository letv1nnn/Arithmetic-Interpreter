The Lox --> https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html

I've extended datatypes in the book, specifically I've added number shifting, left, right.
Also, I've managed to use:
  Binary:
    High priority: ['*', '/', '&', '%', '<<', '>>']
    Low priority: ['+', '-', '^', '|']
  Unary:
    ['-', '~']
